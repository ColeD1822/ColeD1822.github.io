    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>Im excited to see where where my career in IT will take me. I have 2 years left of college and I'm looking
forward to what I have planned in the future. <b>I want to make a difference in the world with the skills I have learned
so far throughout my years of schooling.</b></p>
    <p>I plan to travel the world in my later years and I want to spend a lot of time in sunny/ tropical areas. I 
want to travel to Spain and spend a lot of time there in my later years. I enjoy Spanish culture and I have been 
learning the language for a few years and plan to use it for my future career as well if needed. I have a lot to look 
forward to and I am excited to see where my journey after college will take me!</p>
