    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <h3>Soccer</h3>
    <p>While in school, I played club soccer in Kansas City. For Staley High School, I played varsity soccer. I was a #9 forward and a #7 winger/attacker. Soccer is my favorite 
and most passionate sport. I watch my favorite teams play on Saturdays or during the week
when the Champions League Games are on. In Europe, FC Barcelona and Chelsea Football Club are my favorite teams to watch. </p>

    <h3>Football</h3>
    <p>I love to watch football on Sunday's when the NFL is on. I like to watch the Chiefs play the most out of any NFL team
because they are the most fun to watch.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>Video Games</h3>
    <p>My main hobby other than playing and watching soccer is playing video games. I enjoy spending time with friends
on my personal computer or console. Some of my favorite memories are spent playing video games with friends.</p>
