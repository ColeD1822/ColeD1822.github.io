        <h1>Introduction to Me!</h1>
        <p>My name is Cole Dennis. I am a student at the University of Missouri. My major is in information technology. During the pandemic, I helped people in Kansas City build computers for work and school. Building computers and helping people is something that I 
enjoy so much that I knew a career in IT was perfect for me. I plan to continue my education at the University of 
Missouri and want to find an Internship that suits me!</p>
<br />
        <p>I have experience with computers and want to find a position that will expand my skillset. It
fascinates me how much technology continues to develop within the industry. My main goal is to contribute and 
help make a difference wherever my career takes me!</p>
